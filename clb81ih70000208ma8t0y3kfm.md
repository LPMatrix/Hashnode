# Laravel Best Practices

## Introduction
Laravel is one of the most popular web frameworks for developing applications. It is the most popular PHP framework and used by many developers to create robust web applications. It offers a lot of features and tools to make web development easier and efficient. Here are some best practices that you should follow while using Laravel.

## 1. Keep Your Controllers Clean:

Laravel encourages developers to keep the controllers clean and simple. All the logic should be written in the model layer. The controller should only handle request routing and variables. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.

## 2. Use Route Model Binding:

Route model binding is a great feature of Laravel which allows you to retrieve a model instance directly from the route. This helps to reduce the amount of code required to retrieve models and improves the readability of the code.

## 3. Use Blade Templates:

Blade is a powerful templating engine provided by Laravel. It allows you to write clean and elegant syntax for your views. It also provides some great features like layouts, sections, and components which make view development easier.

## 4. Use Queues for Long Running Tasks:

Queues are a great way to handle long running tasks in the background. This helps to improve the performance of the application by offloading the processing to the background.

## 5. Use Repositories for Database Interaction:

Repositories are classes that wrap the database interaction logic. This helps to keep the code clean and organized. It also makes it easy to test the code since you can easily mock the repository instead of the database.

## 6. Use Service Containers:

Service containers are classes that wrap the logic of the application. This helps to keep the code organized and makes it easier to test.

## 7. Use the Laravel Debugbar:

The Laravel Debugbar is a great tool to help debug your application. It provides a real-time view of the queries, events and other information.

## 8. Use Artisan Commands:

Artisan commands are a great way to automate tasks in your application. It also helps to make the code more organized and readable.

## 9. Use Eloquent ORM:

Eloquent is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) provided by Laravel. It provides an easy way to interact with your database and perform CRUD operations.

## 10. Use the Cache:

The Laravel cache is a great way to improve the performance of your application. It allows you to store data in the cache and retrieve it quickly.

## Conclusion
Following these best practices will help you create better applications faster. It will also help you maintain your code and make it easier to read.
