## Introduction

Working in a startup environment is a thrilling experience filled with innovation, rapid development, and collaboration. A crucial aspect of this fast-paced setting is the weekly routine, which revolves around key meetings that drive the company's progress. In this article, we delve into a typical week at a startup I worked at, focusing on the standup, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings that form the backbone of the team's workflow.

## **Monday: Kickstarting the Week with the Standup Meeting**

Mondays at the startup kick off with a standup meeting. The entire team gathers, virtually, to share updates on their ongoing tasks. Each member briefly highlights what they accomplished the previous week, what they plan to work on during the current week, and any roadblocks they've encountered. This provides a clear picture of the team's progress and helps identify potential blockers early on.

The standup meeting is designed to be concise, with members sticking to a strict time limit (30 minutes) to ensure efficiency. It promotes transparency and accountability, allowing everyone to stay informed about their colleagues' activities, and fostering a sense of camaraderie and alignment.

## **Biweekly: Focused Sprint Planning**

The team identifies a set of tasks to tackle during the upcoming sprint – a fixed period of focused work, typically lasting one to two weeks. During this meeting, the team discusses:

**The tasks and their scopes**

**Estimate the effort required (ticket sizing -&gt; S(mall), M(edium), L(arge))**

**Each team member picks a task they'd like to work on and assign it to themselves**

This collaborative effort ensures that tasks are well-defined and the workload is distributed evenly.

Sprint planning sessions are dynamic, often involving brainstorming and discussions about the best approaches to solve specific problems. Tasks are prioritized based on their importance and potential impact. By the end of the sprint planning meeting, each team member has a clear understanding of their responsibilities and the collective goal for the sprint.

## **End of Sprint: Retrospective Meeting**

As the week comes to a close, the team engages in a retrospective meeting on Friday. The prime directive of the retrospective meeting as stated by Norm kerth is

*‘Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what was known at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.’*

This session focuses on reviewing the following, with inputs from every team member:

**What went well?**:

**What didn't go well?:**

**What can Improve?:** What things can be improved on by the team

**Shoutout:** This is where team members give kudos to one another. From the person that helped you with a task to another one that shared a resource with you.

The team reflects on their accomplishments, identifies bottlenecks or obstacles that arose, and discusses strategies to enhance the workflow.

The retrospective meeting isn't just about addressing challenges – it's also a celebration of achievements, both big and small. This meeting contributes to the startup's culture of continuous improvement, fostering an environment where innovation and growth are encouraged.

## Friday Meetings

1. **Parking Lot Meeting (3:00 - 3:30 pm):** In the journey of a startup, challenges and roadblocks are inevitable. However, not every issue can be resolved instantly. The parking lot meeting serves as a designated space to address these challenges that couldn't be discussed during other meetings. It ensures that no concern goes unnoticed and creates a supportive environment for problem solving.
    
2. **Design Meeting (3:30 - 4:00 pm):** Innovation and design are vital components of any startup's success. The weekly design meeting provides a dedicated platform to discuss design-related topics. Whether it's refining product features, brainstorming new concepts, or aligning the user experience, this meeting cultivates creativity and drives the company's vision forward.
    

## Benefits of this Meeting Structure

1. **Clear Communication:** The structured meeting schedule ensures that everyone is on the same page. Teams are updated on progress, challenges, and plans regularly, reducing misunderstandings and enhancing collaboration.
    
2. **Accountability:** With set meeting times and specific agendas, individuals are more accountable for their tasks and commitments. This structure minimizes the risk of tasks falling through the cracks.
    
3. **Adaptability:** The retrospective and parking lot meetings provide avenues for adaptive problem-solving. They allow the team to adjust strategies and tactics swiftly in response to challenges or opportunities.
    
4. **Innovation:** The design meeting fuels innovation by providing a consistent space for creative thinking. This helps the startup stay ahead in a competitive market.
    
5. **Culture of Learning:** The retrospective meeting encourages a culture of learning and growth by acknowledging both successes and failures. This culture propels the team to continuously improve and evolve.
    

## **Conclusion**

A typical week at a startup is a symphony of collaboration, innovation, and progress, anchored by the standup, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings. These meetings ensure that the team remains aligned, focused, and adaptable, essential traits in the ever-changing landscape of a startup. While these meetings provide structure, they are also flexible enough to accommodate the unpredictable nature of startup life. As the startup evolves and faces new challenges, these meetings serve as the compass that guides the team toward success.
